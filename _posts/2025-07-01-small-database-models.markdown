title:  "An example for metrics assisted modeling of database performance"
date:   2025-07-01
comments: true
tags: [performance, PostgreSQL, modeling]
overview: "PostgreSQL community conferences, as many other industry driven events, usually
do not have proceedings or anything similar. All you get is a slide deck and,
if you're lucky, a video recording. But it often feels not enough, as it was
with one of my talks last year at PGConfDE, where the topic I was talking about
included examples of mathematical modeling to predict how the database
will behave. Plenty of things were not said or were not communicated with
enough details, because they were simply not fitting the format.

The long story short, I've managed to summarize the talk as a whitepaper [1] in
much more depth and uploaded it to Zenodo, a European open research repository
operated by CERN. Let me know what you think about it.
