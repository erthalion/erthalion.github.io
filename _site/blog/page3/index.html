        Gentoo and Lenovo u430p - the sad story
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Feb 2015</span>

    <p>Finally, I decided to replace my old laptop, and my chose fell on the Lenovo u430p. As I understand now, it was not a good idea in case of Gentoo =) Actually, I was surprised, how many nerves you can lose only because of the adaptation of you hardware to your requirements. And here is the shortlist of what you shouldn’t forget, if you want to do the same more easily.</p>

        Use an exception instead of the NaN

    <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2014</span>

    <p>This is a small notice about a very useful trick. I often have to deal with computations, because the CFD is the part of my activity. And one of the annoying problem in this kind of research is when after many hours of computations you got a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Not A Number</code> result, caused by a stupid mistake. It would be nice, if a computation was interrupted by the NaN.</p>

        From bash to fish
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2014</span>

    <p>I’m doing a small revolution in my environment from time to time. I think “hey, a cool stuff”, take a deep breath and doing something new. And this is story about my migration from the bash to the fish shell.</p>

<p>Let’s see, what says the official tutorial:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>fish is a fully-equipped command line shell (like bash or zsh) that is smart and user-friendly. fish supports powerful features like syntax highlighting, autosuggestions, and tab completions that just work, with nothing to learn or configure.
If you want to make your command line more productive, more useful, and more fun, without learning a bunch of arcane syntax and configuration options, then fish might be just what you’re looking for!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is almost true =) But there is another concrete reason, why I like fish shell:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Search by history (as an autocomplete by tab)</li>
  <li>More intuitive and clean configuration files</li>
  <li>Vim mode <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/65">support</a></li>
</ul>

        Little guide about the gnuchess

    <span class="post-date">25 May 2014</span>

    <p>I’m at the beginning of my journey into the world of gnuchess. Its interface is a slightly tricky, than I’ve expected, but I was interested. So I’ve decided to make some notes about this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GNU Chess performs at the senior master/weak international master strength of 2500+ on the Elo rating system</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know, what does this mean really, but sounds cool =)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is often used in conjunction with a GUI program such as XBoard or glChess</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it’s not our way. Let’s try to use original teminal-based client (more terminal for the terminal god, mwuahahahaha =).</p>
