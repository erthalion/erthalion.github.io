  <blockquote>
  <p>As such, there’s really no “standard” benchmark that will inform you about
the best technology to use for your application. Only your requirements, your
data, and your infrastructure can tell you what you need to know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For already some time I can’t stop doing interesting/useful/weird (one at the
time) benchmarks to reveal some details on how to apply document-oriented
approach in the world of relational databases. Finally, I decided that I have a
critical mass of those details to share in the form of blog post. So welcome to
The Benchmark Club, where we’re going to discuss what it takes to create a fair
performance comparison of different databases. As you may guess, the first rule
of The Benchmark Club is to never share a reproducible benchmarks. But we
identify ourselves as a badass engineers, so we’re going to break this rule
today.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/fight_club.jpg" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<h2 id="targets">Targets</h2>

<p>It’s not possible to compare all the existing solutions to store and process
the data in form of documents (although looks like people usually expect exactly
that), so I’ve limited my scope to PostgreSQL, MySQL and MongoDB:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>PostgreSQL - just because it’s an enlightened database, which is a part of my
very existence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MySQL - also has quite decent implementation of binary json, so it’s
interesting to compare PostgreSQL with one of its closest rival.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MongoDB - one of the most popular NoSQL databases. Sort of synonym for
“document-oriented” approach as for me.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>

<p>Unfortunately for me, I don’t have any bare metal servers to test the
performance. So all my tests were made using AWS EC2, which has its own pros
and cons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Super easy to reproduce the same results on your own.</li>
  <li>Many companies use AWS as a main platform to run their infrastructure, so my
results maybe even more relevant for them.</li>
  <li>But there are some implications of using EC2 for performance tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>My typical benchmark environment had two EC2 instances, one for a workload
generator, another for a database. I was using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m4.large</code> instance type with a
gp2 ELB volume and the default Ubuntu 16.04 AMI image, so HVM virtualization
was available. Both instances were in the same availability zone, VPC and
placement group, so we eliminated significant networking issues.</p>

<p>But it’s not really enough to be confident in results. There are still some
interesting performance-relevant <a href="http://henrikingo.github.io/presentations/Highload%202017%20-%20Measuring%20performance%20variability%20of%20EC2/index.html#/title">details</a> about using
EC2 (e.g. it’s usually advised to disable hyper-threading to get better
latency), and in general benchmarking is quite dangerous area (only insane
persons join The Benchmark Club, because everyone thinks he is smarter than
you, but no one wants to help). To at least partially mitigate those possible
issues and make sure that my tests are more reproducible I tried to be as
careful as possible - for almost every use case I did at least 4 rounds of the
same benchmark (and usually even more).</p>

<p>As a tool for benchmarks I used YCSB, which is a quite well-known instrument to
test the performance of NoSQL databases. It provides many interesting types of
workload, but unfortunately only documents of quite simple structure are
involved. To be more precise, YCSB uses simple flat documents with some number
of keys and corresponding values, which is not that close to the reality from
my point of view. That’s why I also created a <a href="https://github.com/erthalion/ycsb">fork</a> of this tool,
where I introduced the possibility of creating documents with some complex
structure, and drivers for PostgreSQL (jsonb) and MySQL (binary json) (warning:
I should mention, that it’s not a code I can be proud of, but you know - “it
works for me”).</p>

<p>To create an environment, I have an <a href="https://github.com/erthalion/ansible-ycsb">ansible playbook</a> (for
those of you who had seen my talks about this topic on various conferences,
this playbook always was public, but after some time I stopped to include it
into my slides, since there was no real feedback), that accepts some parameters
like EC2 key, availability zone and other stuff, and creates all the required
instances, configures them, and starts data load stage and actual test. The
only thing you need to do manually is to create subnets with all the security
groups for your databases (I’m just to lazy to automate it). Unfortunately,
Ansible itself became an issue at some point, since it still uses Python2,
which is not available on the latest versions of Ubuntu, so there are few hack
required to be able to use it.</p>

<p>Besides running database itself, every instance also collecting system metrics
using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sar</code> tool (plus some database related metrics from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pgview</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mongotop</code>), and they’re available after a test.</p>

<p>Few random notes. I’m not sure about current situation, but when I was writing
all those scripts there was no proper service in the latest versions of Ubuntu
for the latest version of MongoDB. Which means I had to include one more
template and create this service myself.</p>

<p>Another nice thing that costs me several sleepless nights is something called
“unattended-upgrades”. This Ubuntu service could wake up sometimes and start to
update the system. Besides the minor fact that I just don’t need to have this
overhead, this caused test failures sometimes because of a lock for package
installation. So I disabled it. Generaly speaking, to prevent flaky tests it
totally makes sense to add Ansible retry to update packages section, something
like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ansible">until: update_result.stderr == ""
retries: 10
delay: 1
ignore_errors: yes
</code></pre>

<p>One more thing that you can do to make your life easier is to add</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>host_key_checking = False # we know our hosts
timeout = 60  # or even more
pipelining = True # reduce number of SSH operations
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ansible.cfg</code> on your host machine (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pipelining</code> theoretically can break
compatibility with sudoers configurations, but I never experienced anything
like that in my tests).</p>

<p>To save some money and time, almost for all tests I actually used already
prepared AMI images with everything I need. But if you preload test data into
this image, you have to understand, that obviously there will be no data in the
cache at the start of a test.</p>

<h1 id="configurations">Configurations</h1>

<p>In my tests I used some variety of database versions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>PostgreSQL 9.6.3/10</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MongoDB 3.2.5/3.4.4</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MySQL 5.7.19/8.0.3</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To make it simple, you can assume that we’re using the latest stable version,
and I’m going to mention a particular version only if it makes some performance
difference.</p>

<p>When dealing with configurations for these databases, I tried to adjust only
those options, that were directly related to either instance parameters or the
nature of a workload. Everything more detailed I left for the next part of my
research. This led me to the following important options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>PostgreSQL</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>shared_buffers</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>effective_cache_size</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>max_wal_size</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>checkpoint_completion_target</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MySQL</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>innodb_buffer_pool_size</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>innodb_log_file_size</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MongoDB</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>write concern level</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>checkpoints</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>eviction</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>transaction_sync (just out of curiosity, it’s not really recommended to
use)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Few important notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>proper data consistency is used for all the tests (which means write concern
journaled for MongoDB)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SSL was disabled (it’s like that for PostgreSQL and MongoDB, for MySQL driver
I had to disable it manually)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for PostgreSQL and MySQL prepared statements were used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all databases were used in a single instance form. For MongoDB it’s actually
quite unnatural, and usually you want to use replication to get the eventual
consistency. But at the same time it allows us to test all involved databases
under the similar conditions when they do more or less the same work. Right
now I’m working on the second part of my test suite to test databases
clusters, so you can think about this one as a first step, that nonetheless
is quite interesting by itself.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And few words about types of documents that were involved. With the default
YCSB I can define:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“simple” or “small” document - 10 keys and values, every value is 100
random characters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“large” document - 100 keys and values, every value is 200 random characters</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And using my fork I also can define:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“complex” document - 100 keys and values that form a tree with 3 nesting
levels, every value is 100 random characters</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="read-workload">Read workload</h1>

<p>YCSB provides several interesting <a href="https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Workloads">types of workload</a> to
simulate real world situations. Let’s start with the simples one, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WorkloadC</code>,
that consists 100% of read queries. Every read query fetches a single document
by its ID, so we need to discuss how can we index our documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>PostgreSQL - we can index either a single path/multiple paths (using regular
functional index) or all paths (using GIN index) inside a document.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MongoDB - we can index either a signle path or multiple paths inside a
document.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MySQL - there is no direct support for indexing binary json, but we can
create a virtual column and index it as usual. So, again, a single or
multiple paths inside a document.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s try to make a simple performance test using “default” indexing approach,
which means we’re going to index an entire document for PostgreSQL, only ID in
MongoDB, and only ID in a separate virtual column in MySQL.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/select_jsonb_path_ops_throughput.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>This graph represents throughput for under a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WorkloadC</code> for all the databases.
By Ox we have a number of clients that are querying our databases, so basically
it’s a level of concurrency. By Oy there is a throughput value.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/select_jsonb_path_ops_latency_99.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>On this graph you can see a 99th percentile of latency for the same test.</p>

<p>And I bet you already have a lot of questions about this data. Since we strive
to get a fair comparison, we need to discuss and explain them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Why there is a spike for all of them at about 20 clients?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why there is a performance degradation for MongoDB when number of clients is
growing?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why there is a performance gap between MySQL and MongoDB?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why there is a performance gap between PostgreSQL and MongoDB?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="spike-at-20-clients">Spike at 20 clients</h2>

<p>That one is probably the easiest one and it relates to an instance
configuration. The next graph shows the CPU consumption for PostgreSQL
in a test with exactly 20 clients.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/pg_select_cpu_20.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>As you can see, CPU resources almost completely consumed, and judging from the
same metrics before 20 clients we still have some capacity. So that’s the
explanation for this spike.</p>

<h2 id="performance-degradation-for-mongodb">Performance degradation for MongoDB</h2>

<p>It was tricky to find out what’s happening here, because all the metrics that
I’ve got from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sar</code> were on the same level for 20 and 100 clients. So, as part
of my investigation I started to trace MongoDB with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">perf</code>. It turns out that
the only two metrics that were growing significantly were number of CPU
migrations events and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sched_yield</code> system calls.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/mongodb_cpu_migrations.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>This led me to a conclusion that MongoDB has some problems with spinlocks,
since the only module that has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sched_yield</code> system call is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spin_lock.cpp</code>.
Interesting enough is that this situation is getting better between releases
(but it’s still quite significant), for example here is comparison of
throughput for 3.2 and 3.4:</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/throughput_mongodb.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<h2 id="mysql-vs-mongodb">MySQL vs MongoDB</h2>

<p>Actually the performance for MySQL in the first tests was even worse. It turns
out, that since in MySQL we’re using a virtual column, we have to tell
explicitly that it should be stored using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">STORED</code> statement:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">usertable</span> <span class="p">(</span>
<span class="k">data</span> <span class="n">JSON</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="n">ycsb_key</span> <span class="nb">VARCHAR</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">255</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">GENERATED</span> <span class="n">ALWAYS</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">JSON_EXTRACT</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">data</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'$.YCSB_KEY'</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="n">STORED</span> <span class="k">PRIMARY</span> <span class="k">KEY</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But even with this improvement it has lower throughput in this test. My
colleagues from MySQL side claim that it’s happened mostly because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">performance
schema</code> collects more data and involves more actions than similar mechanisms in
other databases, which obviously leads to a bigger overhead. But at the same
time no one really disables it in production environment, and so far I decided
to do the same for my performance tests.</p>

<h2 id="postgresql-vs-mongodb">PostgreSQL vs MongoDB</h2>

<p>I assume this one is most important questions for you now. Why PostgreSQL is
underperforms so significantly? The answer is simple, we’re doing an unfair
benchmark. As you may notice, we were indexing only an ID in a document for
MySQL and MongoDB, and an entire document for PostgreSQL. So, let’s try to fix
that.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/select_btree_throughput.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>Here we can see absolutely the same test with the very change that we’re
discussing, namely indexing only an ID for PostgreSQL. It’s clear now, that
throughput for PostgreSQL and MongoDB now is almost the same before the
spinlock performance degradation hits MongoDB. There is still a gap between
PostgreSQL and MySQL though, and there are two factors contribute to this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">performance schema</code> as mentioned before</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>prepared statements, since in MySQL they cache less information than in
PostgreSQL, and consequently they are not that effective</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And now let’s discuss a bit our results. We’ve got so far that throughput of
PostgreSQL and MongoDB is the same for read workloads. Is it surprising? Not at
all - I’m going to show you, that under the hood all our databases use more or
less the same data structures and the same approach to store documents. Taking
this into account, and also the same type of indices and the same environment
it’s quite natural that we’ve got the same numbers.</p>

<h2 id="data-structures">Data structures</h2>

<p>When we’re talking about how to store a document in a database, we usually have
two concerns - our document should occupy as small a possible space, but at the
same time we should be able to work with it efficiently. And thing is that to
achieve that the only thing we can do is basically put some small amount of
extra information into a document, e.g. for every key in it we can store a type
and size of a corresponding value. That’s what we have in one or another form
in all our target databases.</p>

<p>Here is a diagram that represents the internal structure of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jsonb</code> in
PostgreSQL:</p>

<p><img src="/diagrams/jsonb.dot.png" border="0" width="50%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>What we can see here is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an overall document size</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a tree, every node of which has a header and actual content</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s zoom a bit into a node structure:</p>

<p><img src="/diagrams/jsonb_header.dot.png" border="0" width="80%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>Basically, a node header has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value type</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value size</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">offset</code> and one
cryptic flag to decide whether we store a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">size</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">offset</code>. It was done like
that in attempt to find the balance - using an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">offset</code> we can get more access
speed by the cost of compressibility, and better compressibility we can get
using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">size</code>.</p>

<p>And here is a similar diagram for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bson</code> in MongoDB:</p>

<p><img src="/diagrams/bson.dot.png" border="0" width="50%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>Not surprisingly we see almost the same picture with a document size, nodes in
form of a tree structure and every node has its own header and actual content.
And again let’s take a look at a node header structure:</p>

<p><img src="/diagrams/bson_header.dot.png" border="0" width="50%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>As before (not that many options), we have here <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value type</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value size</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">key name</code> which is one small but interesting difference. The thing is that for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jsonb</code> we store all keys and values in a variable sized content section, and
implicitly apply some order for them. In case of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bson</code> we store a key
directly in a node header.</p>

<p>Now let’s explore the internal structure of binary json in MySQL:</p>

<p><img src="/diagrams/mysql_json.dot.png" border="0" width="50%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>As you could guess, nodes in form of a tree, but this time without an explicit
header - all the information is stored in a variable sized content block. Let’s
go deeper:</p>

<p><img src="/diagrams/mysql_json_header.dot.png" border="0" width="50%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>Here, together with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">size</code>, keys and values we have one interesting difference -
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pointers</code>, which is an offset from the beginning of a document where you can
find this particular key or value. As far as I understood from MySQL source
code, it was done like that to be able to work with a document in a lazy way.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing about how documents are stored, is key/values order.</p>

<p><img src="/diagrams/keys_order.dot.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>For <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jsonb</code> and binary json we actually group keys and values from the same
level together. The reason is simple, in this way we can access keys a bit
faster, it’s easy to cache them and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>Let’s summarize. All our databases use more or less the same approach to store
documents, and there are only minor differences. Just for fun here are few
examples of those differences on binary level for a simple document:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">"a"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">"b"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"xyz"</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jsonb</code> document looks like in PostgreSQL:</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/jsonb_binary.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>We can clearly see some parts of its structure and grouped together keys and
values.</p>

<p>The same for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bson</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/bson_binary.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>As you can see the situation here is opposite, all keys and values are
following in the natural order, with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value type</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value size</code> etc.</p>

<p>And finally binary json:</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/mysql_binary.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>Again, quite long header with some pointers in it, and then grouped keys and values.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing to mention is that in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jsonb</code> variable sized content
and header are aligned by 4 bytes. Quite simple on its own it leads to
interesting consequences, for example here are two documents:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">"a"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"aa"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">"b"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">"a"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">"b"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"aa"</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>These two documents have identical size since we just swapped values, nothing
more. But if you’ll try to store them in PostgreSQL, you’ll see that the second
one will take 2 more bytes of disk space:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="k">VALUES</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'{"a": "aa", "b": 1}'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/align_short.png" border="0" width="60%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="k">VALUES</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'{"a": 1, "b": "aa"}'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/align_long.png" border="0" width="80%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>We can clearly see 4 extra bytes in the second document before and after keys
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b</code>. Since the first one has 2 bytes longer header, at the end we
have this 2 bytes difference. Of course, it’s not that much, but in some cases
maybe worth mentioning.</p>

<h2 id="complex-documents">Complex documents</h2>

<p>What we tested before involved quite simple type of flat documents without any
internal structure. As I said before in real life we work with something much
more complex, so let’s try to test the same read workload with the same
environment, but now let’s use documents with some nested information
(“complex” documents):</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/select_complex_btree_throughput.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>What we see here is that numbers are different just because we’re working with
more complicated and bigger documents, but all the patterns are the same.</p>

<h2 id="document-size">Document size</h2>

<p>Another interesting question is how different processing for bigger and smaller
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jsonb</code> documents. Let’s replicate the same test as before, but now we’ll fix
number of clients to 40 and instead will vary the size of our documents in kB
by Ox.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/workload_c_toast.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>We can see interesting performance drop at about 2kB and more or less linear
degradation on the rest parts of the graph. Can you guess why?</p>

<p><img src="/diagrams/toast.dot.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto; padding: 20px 0 20px 0" /></p>

<p>When we store our document in PostgreSQL, first of all we compress it. If even
after compression a document is too big (yep, you’re right, more than 2kB),
PostgreSQL will split it into multiple chunks, that will be stored in toast
tables.</p>

<h2 id="parsing-time">Parsing time</h2>

<p>There is another interesting hack that you can see while working with jsonb.
It’s perfectly fine to have a query like that:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">test_table</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="k">data</span> <span class="o">@&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'{"key": "123"}'</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">jsonb</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But as you may see to build a jsonb object for this condition PostgreSQL need
to parse a string, that contains jsonb definition. And it’s absolutely not
necessary, since you have many other options to create a jsonb object, e.g.
function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jsonb_build_object</code>:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">test_table</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="k">data</span> <span class="o">@&gt;</span> <span class="n">jsonb_build_object</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'key'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'123'</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s not a super optimization, and I didn’t expect anything from it, but it
turns out, that with a lot of queries you can actually squeeze some ops/sec
using it. For example, let’s take a look at the first test for read-only
workload with GIN index, but now we’re going to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jsonb_build_object</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/select_jsonb_path_ops_no_parse.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>You can see, that in comparison with the original graph PostgreSQL has got few
extra thousands operations per second. Just for the records - this one is a bit
old test, so it involved MongoDB 3.2.5.</p>

<h2 id="scalability">Scalability</h2>

<p>So far we were doing tests using quite modest hardware, which is of course
valuable. But I have to mention, that situation can be in some way different
for more powerful instances. For example, let’s compare the same read-only test
with GIN index over an entire document for PostgreSQL on different machines,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m4.large</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m4.xlarge</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m4.2xlarge</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/scalability.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>The first graph is identical to what we already saw, but there is one
interesting pattern on the following two. You can see, that while getting more
throughput almost linearly, the index-related gap between PostgreSQL and
MongoDB is reducing. How different it’s going to be for other types of workload
we will discuss later.</p>

<h1 id="insert-workload">Insert workload</h1>

<p>Since there are so many interesting workloads in YCSB, let’s explore them. The
next one would be the insert-only workload. Originally I made a mistake here (I
must say I make mistakes professionally, some of them are almost like an art) and
tried to do the test with almost the same setup as before with an index over a
document ID for all databases. The problem is that I had also to configure
checkpoints properly, because default configuration of all databases is just
not suitable for this workload. Let’s take a look:</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/insert_throughput_journaled.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>You can see that data has an oscillating pattern. If, for example, we would
like to see some metrics, we could realize that this test is IO bounded:</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/mongodb_io_bounded_cpu_usage.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/mongodb_io_bounded_io_queue_size.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>On the last graph we can see queue size for IO operations during the time.
Those spikes are correlated with checkpoints, when database is flushing data to
disk, and it’s doing it too frequently. So, taking this into account, let’s
adjust out checkpoints configuration (I’m talking here about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">max_wal_size</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">checkpoint_completion_target</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">innodb_log_file_size</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">checkpoint +
eviction</code>, that I’ve mentioned already. Also, please note, that MySQL has two
journal files by default, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">innodb_log_file_size</code> is for each of them):</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/insert_throughput_wal_size.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>This time data is more representative, and we can see interesting thing, that
PostgreSQL is more competitive here in terms of throughput. MySQL and MongoDB
are on more or less the same level, but there is a catch - actually, to get
a bit more from MySQL I used “wrong” setup, when virtual column for
a document id had no <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PRIMARY KEY</code> statement. In this case we can get better
numbers for insert workloads (but everything else would be terrible), and
without it there would be even less throughput for MySQL. As far as I
understood it’s a well-known situation when MySQL handles insert workload not
that good and there are a lot of forks out there to address this problem.</p>

<h1 id="update-workload">Update workload</h1>

<p>Before we will talk about update workload, let’s discuss another related topic -
what kind of problems can we get while updating jsonb? The thing is that
despite the fact that we think about it as a document with some structure, for
PostgreSQL it’s still a regular data type. Which means sometimes there may be
situations when we touched only small part of a document, but database need to
walk through an entire document to do something. Here are few examples what I’m
talking about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Update one field of a document</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DETOAST of a document</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reindex of a document</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reindex">Reindex</h2>

<p>The story here is quite simple. So far in PostgreSQL if you created a
functional index for a jsonb column, and then updated some part of a document,
that was not involved in index at all, database will still reindex this
document. To see if it can be significant or not let’s make another test with
two setups - one is when we have an index on ID from a document and another
when we have an index on a separate column that contains the same kind of ID,
just separately from a document. As a workload for this test I used
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WorkloadA</code>, which is 50% of updates and 50% of reads, everything else was
similar to previous tests.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/update_reindex.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>From this graph we can see, that there is a difference in throughput. It maybe
not that significant, but please keep in mind that it heavily depends on
document type, and I would expect that for large and more complicated documents
(where reindex can introduce more overhead) this difference is going to be
bigger. And I glad to mention that some <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/4d9928ee-a9e6-15f9-9c82-5981f13ffca6%40postgrespro.ru#4d9928ee-a9e6-15f9-9c82-5981f13ffca6@postgrespro.ru">work</a>
on this is underway.</p>

<h2 id="detoast">DETOAST</h2>

<p>Let’s compare following two queries:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="k">data</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="s1">'key1'</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="s1">'key2'</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="k">table</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="k">data</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="s1">'key1'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">data</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="s1">'key2'</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="k">table</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At the first glance there is no significant differense between them, but this
impression is wrong. In the first case <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code> is detoasted just once,
everything is fine. Unfortunately, in the second case <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code> is detoasted twice
for both keys. And it’s like that not only for jsonb, but for all composite
data types in PostgreSQL. In general, it’s not a big issue, but if our document
is quite big and we’re trying to extract too many keys, we can end up with huge
overhead.</p>

<p>To proof this statement let’s make an experiment and repeat the same read-only
test as before (with an index on ID for PostgreSQL). But this time we’re going
to fetch just 10% of a large document:</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/select_slice_10_btree_throughput.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>We can clearly see, that in this case overhead is tremendous for both
PostgreSQL and MySQL. There are two possible solutions for this problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Disable compression for jsonb column using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER
COLUMN column SET STORAGE EXTERNAL</code>. In this case you can more or less avoid
detoasting overhead by the cost of disk space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change the query</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I want to elaborate a bit on the last one. Since we work within a proper
relational database we can just convert our document to a SQL structure like a
record and then do whatever we want:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TYPE</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">"a"</span> <span class="nb">TEXT</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">"b"</span> <span class="nb">TEXT</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="n">test_jsonb</span> <span class="k">VALUES</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">q</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">test_jsonb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">jsonb_populate_record</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">NULL</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">test</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">data</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="n">q</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And it’s actually quite common pattern to work with documents in PostgreSQL so
far, since there is no full-fledged support for Json Path. Of course there are
<a href="https://github.com/postgrespro/jsquery">extensions</a> that provide something like Json Path, there is even this
big thing <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/CAF4Au4w2x-5LTnN_bxky-mq4%3DWOqsGsxSpENCzHRAzSnEd8%2BWQ%40mail.gmail.com#CAF4Au4w2x-5LTnN_bxky-mq4=WOqsGsxSpENCzHRAzSnEd8+WQ@mail.gmail.com">SQL/JSON</a> coming to PostgreSQL. But at least at the moment
to get a solution when Json Path is truly necessary we can use this “unwrap”
pattern.</p>

<p>Let’s imagine that we have a collection of documents, and from every document
we want to extract all items with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value = "aaa"</code>:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">[{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"items"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">"id"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">"value"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"aaa"</span><span class="p">},</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">"id"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">"value"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"bbb"</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">},</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"items"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">"id"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">"value"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"aaa"</span><span class="p">},</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">"id"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">"value"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"bbb"</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}]</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>For that we can “unwrap” documents using function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jsonb_array_elements</code> to do
something like that:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">WITH</span> <span class="n">items</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">jsonb_array_elements</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">data</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="s1">'items'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="n">item</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">test</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">items</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">item</span><span class="o">-&gt;&gt;</span><span class="s1">'value'</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'aaa'</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or similar situation when we want to get all items with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">status = true</code>:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"items"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="nl">"item1"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">"status"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">},</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="nl">"item2"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">"status"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">},</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="nl">"item3"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">"status"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again we can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jsonb_each</code> function to unwrap our document:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">WITH</span> <span class="n">items</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">jsonb_each</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">data</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="s1">'items'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="n">item</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">test</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="k">key</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">items</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="o">-&gt;&gt;</span><span class="s1">'status'</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'true'</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course this approach can lead to quite verbose queries (just imagine if you
want to update something in a document this way, you have to “unwrap” and
“wrap” it back) and that’s why we have patches like SQL/JSON. But at the same
time don’t think about that as an ugly hack, because in fact it’s quite
important thing - it’s a point when document-oriented approach meets relational
approach, a point when you can apply full power of SQL to your documents.</p>

<h2 id="update">Update</h2>

<p>Now let’s finally talk about update workload. The problem here is that when we
update let’s say one field of a jsonb document, PostgreSQL will write to
journal an entire document, and as you can imagine it’s an overhead. The
question is when this overhead can be significant? Let’s experiment with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WorkloadA</code> with default checkpoint configuration and documents of small size:</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/update_btree_journaled_throughput.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>Interesting enough that we have more or less stable data, and overhead that
I’ve mentioned before is insignificant. Not let’s do the same with properly
adjusted checkpoints:</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/update_btree_wal_size.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>Here we can see another interesting thing - after checkpoints adjustment
PostgreSQL and MySQL are at the same level in terms of throughput, and,
unfortunately, configuration for MongoDB didn’t help so much. At first, I
thought that I configured checkpoints incorrectly and MongoDB is still doing
them too frequently (and it makes sense, since I was using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log_size</code> option to
adjust the journal size, but it turns out that WiredTiger has a limitation on
maximum value for it 2Gb). But even after I switched on using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wait</code> option and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">db.serverStatus()</code> was showing that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transaction checkpoints</code> is 1, the
throughput was still at the same level.</p>

<p>At the end of the day I’m still investigating this performance gap, buy anyway
the expected results would be that MongoDB throughput is below PostgreSQL and
MySQL, just not that much. And this time again we can say, that overhead I’ve
mentioned before is insignificant. Now let’s make the same test with the same
configurations, but for large documents:</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/update_btree_large_throughput.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>And finally overhead is significant. To demonstrate that, let’s see what would
happen if we want to update this small document:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"aaa"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"aaa"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"bbb"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"bbb"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"ccc"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"ccc"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We want to change the first field:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"aaa"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"ddd"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"bbb"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"bbb"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"ccc"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"ccc"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And here is what we will have in the journal for different databases:</p>

<p>PostgreSQL</p>

<p>We can clearly see, that MongoDB is only writing a difference between the old
and new documents.</p>

<p>But there is one interesting thing - actually, when we update a document, if
both old and new versions of it are on the same page, PostgreSQL will write
only the difference to the journal which is what we want. The problem is that
documents tend to be quite bigger, so that the possibility of being on the same
page is lower than usual (even for a small document like one above on my laptop
it was somehow not all the time). And obvious way to improve the situation is
to enable huge pages. As a quick reminder, you can use <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/kernel-resources.html">this</a>
or <a href="https://people.planetpostgresql.org/devrim/index.php?/archives/83-Using-huge-pages-on-RHEL-7-and-PostgreSQL-9.4.html">this</a> instructions to estimate how many pages it makes sense to
preallocate:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=1000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and then enable huge pages in PostgreSQL:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>huge_pages = on # by default it's try
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately I don’t have yet any benchmarks for that, but from manual
experiments I can see that, with huge pages 2048kB and simple document type,
updates are saved as diff most of the time.</p>

<p>Note: as Bruce mentioned in the commentaries, actually huge pages have no
effect on the size of heap page. Looks like I’ve got this result on my laptop
because of some side effect of huge pages being enabled. But anyway, you still
can change the PostgreSQL heap page size by compiling it with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--with-blocksize</code>.</p>

<p>Another thing worth mentioning is that this problem also was addressed in the
recent development versions of MySQL, namely 8.0.3. This version has a
<a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json.html">feature</a> called “Partial Updates of JSON Values”, but I
never tested it yet.</p>

<p>Before we’ll finish this section I have to mention, that all the tests were
done using not that powerful EC2 instances, and results actually are different
for setups with e.g. more CPUs. Right now I’m working on that, and in the
meantime you can check out the results (<a href="http://www.sai.msu.su/~megera/postgres/talks/my-highload3.pdf">one</a>,
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/alpine.DEB.2.20.1708240433560.24526%40lancre#alpine.DEB.2.20.1708240433560.24526@lancre">two</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/35960b8af917e9268881cd8df3f88320%40postgrespro.ru#35960b8af917e9268881cd8df3f88320@postgrespro.ru">three</a>) of my colleagues with more competitive
hardware. They actually covered all the workloads that YCSB can provide, but
using a bit different setup mostly with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">synchronous_commit = off</code>.</p>

<h1 id="jsonb-vs-json-vs-table">Jsonb vs Json vs Table</h1>

<p>So far we were comparing three different databases, but the thing is that there
are alternatives to jsonb even inside PostgreSQL itself. If you have to store
some documents it’s absolutely valid question, maybe it makes sense to store
them as a plain json just from performance perspective? Or even unwrap documents
into a proper sql relation because of the same reasons. You may consider these
options if you don’t care that much about flexibility that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jsonb</code> provides.
Let’s see what numbers we’ll get from the same kind of tests between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jsonb</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">json</code> and a regular table:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Relation vs Jsonb, read-only workload</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/postgresql_run_jsonb_jdbc.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>Well, not that much difference.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Relation vs Jsonb, insert-only workload</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/postgresql_load_jsonb_jdbc.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>There is some performance gap but it’s not that big. Basically, we can see,
that since relations are first-class citizens in PostgreSQL, maintain their
internal structure is a bit easier that do it for jsonb. At the same time it’s
almost the same in terms of performance to fetch one row from a relation and
one jsonb document.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plain Json vs Jsonb, read-only workload</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/postgresql_select_json_jsonb.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>Again we can see some performance gap and plain json is a little bit faster. The
explanation is simple - we have some internal structure in jsonb that
introduces some overhead in terms of maintaining this structure and just in
terms of disk space. But as we can see from graph above this overhead is not
that big.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plain Json vs Jsonb, insert-only workload</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/public/img/benchmarks/postgresql_load_json_jsonb.png" border="0" width="100%" style="margin: auto" /></p>

<p>Because of the same reasons that I’ve mentioned above json is a bit faster, but
not significantly.</p>

<p>You may guess, that I’m not talking about update workload at all because it
doesn’t make sense - jsonb will totally outperform json, but it will be slower
in comparison with an sql relation. At this point you may think about jsonb as
something between plain json and sql relation - it has some internal
structure and you can work with it in an efficient manner, and at the same time
it provides some level of flexibility.</p>

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>

<p>The main conclusion is that this is a damn interesting topic to research and
I’m still continuing to do so. I really hope that I can get some positive
feedback and improve my tests even more.</p>

<p>Another interesting conclusion is that basically all the performance
differences I’ve shown above were mostly caused by databases themselves, not by
the way how they handle documents. Which means that it’s totally not a gray
area, it’s something well-known for us. In most cases you may use documents in
relational databases and even migrate from NoSQL solutions, if it’s necessary,
without any fear of significant performance degradation.</p>
